### Model


### Decision Variables
Decision variables are unknowns that can take on a specified range of possible values. Think of them as "eventual" decision variables as the solver will do work and eventually decide the variables value.

This is where a lot of the confusion of constraint programming variables arises. When programming 

## Challenges of Constraint Programming

Expressing the problem (well really the solution)
 - How do you turn a problem description into code (decision variables and constraints)?


What challenges did I face?
 - Expressing the problem
    - Understanding the contraints available
    - Syntax (it's weird)
 
    Thankfully, you can ofen break down the problem into several simplier ones.

    Maybe I pose a problem that seems unrealistic for them to solve and show them how to break it down.
    Offer unit tests for each section


## TODO
 - Instructions on setup for Mac
    - Or use docker or something
