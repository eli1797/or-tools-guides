## Challenges of Constraint Programming

Expressing the problem
 - How do you turn a problem description into code (decision variables and constraints)?


What challenges did I face?
 - Expressing the problem
    - Understanding the contraints available
    - Syntax
 
    Nice thing is the solution here is that constraints are often independent. So you can break down the problem into something reasonable.

    Maybe I pose a problem that seems unrealistic for them to solve and show them how to break it down.
    Offer unit tests for each section

## TODO
 - Instructions on setup for Mac
    - Or use docker or something
